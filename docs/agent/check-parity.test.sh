# The point of the script is that it fails. A parity check that only ever prints
# "they agree" is indistinguishable from no check at all, and this is exactly the
# kind of check that gets written, never fails, and is believed for a year. Each
# case below breaks one thing on purpose and asserts a non-zero exit.
