# Exercises core/compose-dockerfile.sh's substitution of core's own pinned
# versions — the real script, driven through CORE_VERSIONS.
#
# The stacks have had {{VERSION}} since the beginning; core did not, and its
# pins were literals sitting in the middle of a RUN line. What this guards is
# the seam that gave them a file of their own: a placeholder that no key fills
# must stop the compose, loudly and by name, rather than reach `docker build`
# as the literal text `{{CODEX_VERSION}}` and fail there as an npm error about
# a version that does not exist.
