# Proves check-devcontainer-metadata.sh can actually fail, and fails for the
# right reason in each case. A check that has never been seen rejecting
# anything is a line of CI that will stay green through the bug it was written
# for — the same reason core/bin/check-md-size.test.sh exists.
#
# It drives the real checker with its paths overridden at fixtures, rather than
# reimplementing the rules. A copy of a rule is a rule that goes the other way
# six months from now and nobody notices.
#
# **The rule inverted when the label became composed.** It used to be "exactly
# one fragment declares it, and it is core's"; it is now "no fragment declares
# it, and the composed Dockerfile declares exactly one". So the fixtures supply
# two things: the fragments, and what a stub composer prints. The value-level
# cases below are unchanged in substance and now read the composed output,
# which is where the value lives.
#
# The last two cases use no overrides at all and drive the real tree, because a
# harness of fixtures can be perfectly green while the repository it guards is
# broken.
