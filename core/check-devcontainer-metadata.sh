# The static half of what holds `image-declares-its-user` true. It reads the
# Dockerfile fragments rather than an image, so it costs a second and runs
# anywhere — and it catches two failures at the point somebody writes them,
# which is where they are cheap.
#
# **No fragment may declare `devcontainer.metadata`, and the composed Dockerfile
# must declare exactly one.** The fragments are concatenated into one
# Dockerfile, and a `LABEL` with a key that is already set *replaces* it rather
# than merging. So a stack that declared its own would silently take
# `remoteUser` away for that stack alone: nine stacks connect as `abc`, one as
# `root`, nothing fails, and the difference surfaces much later as root-owned
# files in one project.
#
# This rule inverted when the label became composable. `compose-dockerfile.sh`
# now emits it as the last line of the generated Dockerfile, merged from
# `core/devcontainer.json` and each selected stack's — which is what lets the
# remote editor's per-stack extensions exist at all. So the two things worth
# checking moved: that nothing declares it early enough to be replaced, and
# that the composed output declares it once.
#
# **The declaration must not carry `containerUser`.** That field sets the user
# the container is *started* as, and this image has to start as root so
# s6-overlay can apply PUID/PGID and drop privileges itself. Declaring it would
# stop the container booting, with an error naming neither the label nor s6.
# It is the kind of field a reader completes because it looks half-filled, so
# the check guards it rather than a comment asking nicely.
#
# Paths are overridable so this drives the real fragments rather than a copy of
# them, the same reason the cont-init tests take theirs.
