# What may cross into the sandbox as an environment variable.
#
# **Nothing secret may**, and the reason is not a preference: ai-jail re-expands
# `--env NAME` into `--setenv NAME <value>` on the bwrap command line it
# executes, and bwrap runs in the container's PID namespace — so the value is
# readable with `ps` from anywhere else in the container, including a build and
# anything that build runs. The full finding is in
# the debt `forwarded-secrets-land-in-the-sandbox-argv` in the tracker.
#
# **An allowlist, not a denylist of suspicious names.** GH_TOKEN would have been
# caught by a denylist only through the luck of being called a token; the next
# credential may be called anything. Adding a name here is the moment somebody
# has to decide whether it is a secret, which is the review this file exists to
# force.
#
# It reads the argv the real wrappers build, through a stubbed ai-jail, for the
# same reason jail-wrappers.test.sh does: a copy of the list agrees with the
# wrappers today and disagrees the first time somebody edits one.
